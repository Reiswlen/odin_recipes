      <p>Macaroni and cheese, an American classic!  Mac and cheese was a staple for me and many kids growing up due to how tasty it is and how easy it is for kids to make when their parents weren't able to cook for them.  It is easy to make macroni and cheese that is as good or better than the Kraft version which is most popular.</p>
